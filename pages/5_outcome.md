In order to showcase the sort of analysis that our tool can perform, we have worked on a specific dataset, which consists of most New York Times articles published between 1987 and 2007. We are currently writing a separate blog post detailing the results from that analysis. Stay tuned!

We have also open-sourced our tool; the code and instructions on how to run it are available [here](https://github.com/poorna-kumar/gendermeme-core/). This is currently being tested by the Financial Times, and we are also exploring other collaborations with newsrooms and researchers (contact info [here](#Contact)).
