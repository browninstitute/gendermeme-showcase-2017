GenderMeme seeks to analyze gender in the media, at scale. It uses natural language processing techniques to identify the people mentioned and quoted in news articles, and figure out what their genders are. This information can then be aggregated over news corpora to get a picture of gender representation in the media.

GenderMeme is part of the 2016-17 cohort of Magic Grants. Our team consists of two people, Poorna Kumar and Viswajith Venugopal, who both graduated from Stanford University with Master's degrees in Statistics and Computer Science, respectively.
