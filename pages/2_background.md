When proposing our project, our belief was that a more gender-balanced news diet would be beneficial for society: that by giving voice and representation to a greater diversity of people, newsrooms could improve the quality of the news we consume. But to inform any discussion on this subject, it is important to be able to measure gender balance in the news. 
 
We looked at related studies, and discovered that several groups (like the [Womenâ€™s Media Center report](http://wmc.3cdn.net/83bf6082a319460eb1_hsrm680x2.pdf) and the [Global Media Monitoring Project](http://whomakesthenews.org/)) have examined print and online newspapers. Their reports suggest that there is a prevailing lack of gender balance in the news. This gap has been measured in terms of bylines, people mentioned in the news and people quoted in the news.
 
Many of these studies have been done on a small scale, and one of the barriers to larger-scale research is that much of the work of determining gender balance was done by hand: a painstaking process of labelling articles, sources and people mentioned into different categories.
 
This is where GenderMeme comes in. We try to enable these studies to be done on a large scale, easily, by using natural language processing technology to do this analysis computationally.
